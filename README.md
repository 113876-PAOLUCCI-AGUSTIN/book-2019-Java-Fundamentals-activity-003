Activity 3: Calculating the Percent Increase or Decrease of Financial Instruments.
Users expect to see the daily percentage of increase or decrease of financial instruments such as stocks and foreign currency. 
We will ask the user for the stock symbol, the value of the stock on day 1, the value of the same stock on day 2, 
calculate the percent change and print it in a nicely formatted way. 
To achieve this, perform the following steps:
1. Create a new class and enter StockChangeCalculator as the class name.
2. Import the java.util.Scanner package:
3. In the main() use System.out.print to ask the user for the symbol of the stock, followed by the day1 and day2 values of the stock.
4. Calculate the percentChange value.
5. Use System.out.println to output the symbol and the percent change with two decimal digits.
6. Run the main program.
7. The output should be similar to:
Enter the stock symbol: AAPL
Enter AAPL's day 1 value: 100
Enter AAPL's day 2 value: 91.5
AAPL has changed -8.50% in one day.
